## Time complexity

#### Measure time complexity
* Find a formula for the numbers of steps that are needed to be done by the code for a given input.
* Time complexity is a measure of how the running time of an algorithm grows as the size of the input increases.

#### Example
Q. Finding the sum of 1st N natural numbers.
Ans. Sum of A.P. = n*(n+1)/2

#### Time complexities (Ordered best to worse)
1. O(1) - Constant time complexity
2. O(log n) - Logarithmic time complexity
3. 0(n) - Linear time complexity
4. O(nlogn) - Linearithmic time complexity
5. O(n^2) - Quadratic time complexity
6. O(2^n) - Exponential time compexity

#### Comparing different time complexity
```C++
int doRandomStuff(int n) {
    int randomVar =0; // TC is 1
    for(int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        // TC is (1 + 1 + n) * n
        randomVar++;  // TC is 1
        randomVar %= n;  // TC is 1
        for(j = 1; j <= n; ++j) { // TC is n
            randomVar += 2;
        }
    }
    while(n > 0) {
        randomVar /= 2;
        n /= 2;  // n/2^k; k is the iteration; TC is log (base 2) n 
    }
    randomVar = 0;
    return randomVar;
}
```

#### Property of log
* logx^a = alogx
* loga/logb = log (base b)a

## Space complexity
Space complexity measures how memory/space required by an algorithm grows as the size of the input increases.

#### Example
Q. Sum of 100 numbers
